# Slack Connect (Local Demo)

A simple, local-only frontend simulation of a Slack messaging and scheduling application. It runs entirely in your browser â€” **no backend required**.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Simulate connecting to a Slack workspace
- Compose and send messages to mock channels
- Schedule messages for a future date and time
- View a list of all scheduled messages
- Cancel a scheduled message before it's sent
- View a history of all "sent" messages

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **HTML**
- **CSS** (Tailwind CSS via CDN)
- **Vanilla JavaScript**

## ðŸ“¦ How to Run

1. Save the code as `index.html`.
2. Open the file in any web browser.

## âš™ How It Works

### Data Storage
- Uses your browser's **`localStorage`** to save scheduled and sent messages  
- Data **persists** even after refreshing the page

### Scheduling
- A JavaScript `setInterval` function runs every second
- Checks if any scheduled messages are due  
- Moves due messages from **Scheduled** list â†’ **Sent** list automatically
